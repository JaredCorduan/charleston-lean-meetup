## Building and running an executable

Use lake to build an executable.
Lake is packaged with lean and therefore managed by
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan).

The file `lakefile.lean` shows that our target
is named `charleston-lean-meetup`:

https://github.com/JaredCorduan/charleston-lean-meetup/blob/38bb7a248f6f5a3b82f851f3bcd39c6c1d41db6b/lakefile.lean#L10-L12

Note that the guillemets `«` and `»` are not actually needed.
According to the Lean docs:

> Placing guillemets around a name, as in «Greeting», allow it to contain spaces or other characters that are normally not allowed in Lean names, and it allows reserved keywords such as if or def to be used as ordinary names by writing «if» or «def». This prevents issues when the package name provided to lake new contains such characters.

### Run

```shell
~/charleston-lean-meetup$ lake exe charleston-lean-meetup
list:   []
vector: []
array: #[]
~/charleston-lean-meetup$ lake exe charleston-lean-meetup foo bar baz
list:   [foo, bar, baz]
vector: [foo, bar, baz]
array: #[foo, bar, baz]
```
